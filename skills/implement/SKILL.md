description: Implement an approved spec + plan (docs/specs/<name>-spec.md and agents/<name>-plan.md) test-first, driving a two-level focus stack — shared per-plan task stacks (agents/<name>-focus.md) under one per-clone focus stack (agents/state/<clone-id>/focus.md) — so tangents within and across plans always pop back to where you were, without bleeding state between clones. The plan's checkboxes own completion. Use after the design skill once the plan is approved and coding begins.

# implement — execute plans test-first on a two-level work stack

Use this **after the spec and plan are approved** (authored by the **design** skill). It
turns `agents/<name>-plan.md` into working code while keeping the current focus and the
planned order of work visible and recoverable — even across tangents and plan switches.

## The two-level focus stack (a call stack)
Think of it exactly like a runtime call stack: **the frame stack is `focus.md`;
each `agents/<name>-focus.md` is the locals of a frame.**

Both levels share the **`focus`** filename convention — `focus.md` (global) and
`<name>-focus.md` (per-plan) — because both answer *what am I focused on*, at two
granularities: the global file names which **plan**, the per-plan file names which
**task**. Each is still a LIFO stack; only the name is unified.

**Sharing differs by level (this is what keeps clones from bleeding).** When several
working copies check out the same `agents/` repo, the **per-plan task stacks are
shared** but the **global focus stack is per-clone** — see each section below.

### Per-plan task stack — `agents/<name>-focus.md` (one per plan, SHARED across clones)
The LIFO of tasks **within** a plan. It pairs with `agents/<name>-plan.md` (same
`<name>`), is isolated from other plans, and is archived/deleted when the plan closes
(the plan's checkboxes remain the record). While you're away working another plan, this
file is **untouched**, so returning resumes you at the exact task you left.

It is **shared across clones** (committed in `agents/`, no per-clone copy) because a
plan is **single-writer** — only one working copy works a given plan at a time — so
there is nothing to bleed.

Each entry is **exactly one line: the task's canonical outline id, nothing else** —
a reference into the plan, not a copy:

```
<outline-id>
```

**Focus files are bare id stacks.** No task name, description, status, scope notes,
decisions, history, ✅/done prose, or multi-line blocks — the plan
(`<name>-plan.md`) holds *all* of that, and the id is the link back to it. One line
per task, top = current. If an entry seems to need more than its id, that detail
belongs in the plan: add/expand the task there (so it has an id) and keep only the
id here. Discovered work is captured the same way — promote it into the plan first,
then park its id on the stack — never as prose in the focus file.

### Focus stack — `agents/state/<clone-id>/focus.md` (one PER CLONE, cross-plan)
A **thin** LIFO of **which plan/context you're attending to** — frames, not tasks:

```
[<plan-id>]          # a plan you're working
[explore: <what>]    # an ad-hoc tangent outside any plan
```

It grows with attention **depth** (usually 1–3), not task count. The **top frame names
the plan whose task stack you're currently working.** (Referred to below as `focus.md`
for short.)

**Per-clone, because attention is per working copy.** Several clones of the same
project share one `agents/` repo and each runs its own session with its own live
attention — a single shared `focus.md` would bleed one clone's frames into another. So
each clone keeps its focus stack under its own directory:

```
agents/state/<clone-id>/focus.md
```

`<clone-id>` = `<hostname>-<slug>` where `<slug>` is the clone's **absolute
working-copy path** with the leading `/` dropped and every `/` replaced by `-` (e.g.
`proton-home-julian-code-cpp-cajeta-two`). Derive it at runtime from the host name and
`pwd`; create `agents/state/<clone-id>/` on first write. Each clone only ever writes its
own subtree, so commits from different clones never collide. Within one clone the focus
stack is **not** branch-isolated — your attention spans branches in the same working
copy; it is isolated only **across clones**.

## The one rule (push/pop scoping)
- A subtask/blocker **inside the current plan** → push it on **that plan's**
  `<name>-focus.md` (local), work it, pop back.
- A jump to **another plan**, or **free exploration** → push a **frame** on `focus.md`
  and switch to that plan's task stack (creating it if new). When the frame is done,
  **pop `focus.md`** — you're back in the previous plan, and its task stack still holds
  your exact place.

Example `focus.md` while three deep:

```
[explore: net buffer sizing]   ← working now
[cajeta-net]                   ← jumped here from…
[cajeta-ifx]                   ← home; resume when the frames pop
```

## Starting / switching to a plan
Plans are **dependency-ordered**. When you start a plan:

1. Create `agents/<name>-focus.md` and **push its tasks in reverse plan order** — so the
   **first task popped is the first task in the plan**. Push **only uncompleted (`- [ ]`)
   and blocked (`- [~]`) line items**; skip anything already marked done (`- [x]`). When
   resuming a partly-done plan this is what puts you back at the first *remaining* task,
   not the top of a list of finished work.
2. Push a frame `[<name>]` onto `focus.md` (your clone's `agents/state/<clone-id>/focus.md`).

Switching to an already-started plan is just step 2 — its task stack is where you left it.

## Working the top of the stack
Work the task on top of the **current plan's** task stack (the plan named by the top
focus frame). For a coding task, run it **test-first** (the plan's three line-item
subsections):

1. **TDD** — write the task's tests *first*; they should fail for the right reason.
2. **Coding** — implement until all the task's tests pass.
3. **Acceptance** — verify every explicit Acceptance item, plus the implicit criterion
   that all tests pass.

### Completing a task
1. Mark the task's checkbox in the **plan doc** → `- [x]`. *(Completion lives only here.)*
2. **Pop** it from the current plan's task stack.
3. Commit (a unit of work usually maps to one commit), referencing the task.
4. Update the stack file(s) you touched.

### Interruption → push a subtask
A **subtask** that must be worked **before** the current one — a tangent, a
higher-priority item, or a blocker:

- **In the current plan** → push it on the plan's `<name>-focus.md`, work it, pop back.
- **In another plan, or free exploration** → push a frame on `focus.md` and switch.

When it's done, pop back exactly where you left off — this is how we never lose track of
what we were working on, or the order in which we had planned the work.

### Offered options ARE stack items
When you present the user a set of next-step options, you are **reading off the stack** —
the options and the stack must never diverge. On the user's choice:

1. The **picked** option becomes the active top (work it).
2. **Push every unchosen option onto the stack** (the plan's task stack if it's in-plan,
   a `focus.md` frame if it's another plan/tangent) — into the deferred/discovered
   section, **not** left only in prose. An option you offered but didn't capture is an
   option you lost.

Conversely, when deciding *what* options to offer, **draw them from the stack** so the
"what could I do next" you present and the "what's parked" in the files are the same list.
This is what keeps the dashboard honest: the user is always choosing among real,
recorded stack items, never ephemeral suggestions.

### Completing / abandoning a frame
When a plan is finished (or you drop a tangent), **pop the frame** from `focus.md`. On
plan completion, archive or delete its `<name>-focus.md` — the checked plan is the record.

### Can't finish → mark blocked
When a task **can't be finished due to an unexpected dependency**:

1. Mark its checkbox in the plan with `- [~]` (instead of `x`).
2. Note a **reference to the blocking task or section** at the **end of the task line**.
3. Push the dependency — on the same plan's stack if it's in-plan, or as a new `focus.md`
   frame if it lives in another plan — then resume the blocked task once it clears.

## Plan checkbox states
- `- [ ]` — not started
- `- [x]` — done (tests written first + passing, acceptance met)
- `- [~]` — blocked / can't finish (unexpected dependency; reference noted at line end)

## Where the files live
Plans and both stack levels live under **`agents/`**. In split public/private repos
`agents/` is often gitignored or a separate repo — commit the plan + stacks wherever
`agents/` is versioned, not with the code.

Layout when one `agents/` repo is shared by several clones:

```
agents/
  <name>-plan.md                 # SHARED — the plan
  <name>-focus.md                # SHARED — per-plan task stack (single-writer per plan)
  state/<clone-id>/focus.md      # PER CLONE — the global focus stack
```

`focus.md` is per-clone but **not** branch-isolated *within* a clone: your attention
spans branches in the same working copy, but never bleeds across clones. On a fresh
clone without `agents/`, degrade gracefully — work from whatever's present rather than
erroring; create `state/<clone-id>/` the first time you write the focus stack.

## Rules
- **One line per entry, id only:** a focus file is a bare LIFO of canonical ids —
  `focus.md` frames are `[plan-id]` (or `[explore: <what>]`); per-plan entries are a
  bare `outline-id`. Never a name, status, note, or multi-line block. All detail lives
  in the plan; the focus file just points at it. Use the same ids in commit messages so
  state traces back to the plan.
- **Never skip TDD:** a task is "done" only when its tests were written first and pass.
- **Keep the documents accurate:** if reality diverges from the plan, update the plan
  (and reflect it in the stack) rather than silently drifting; update the spec if the
  *requirements* changed.
- **Keep the stacks thin:** one line (a bare id) per entry — they hold *doing* and
  *discovered* as ids, never *done* and never prose; completion lives in the plan's
  checkboxes. The moment an entry wants a sentence, that's the signal to put it in the
  plan and keep only its id here. There is **no** separate completed-log file.
- **Options track the stack:** every next-step option you offer is a stack item; the
  unchosen ones get pushed (deferred), and the options you present are read off the stack.
  Offered choices and recorded stack never diverge.
- **Report honestly:** the stacks are the dashboard — show the real frames, the real task
  stack, failing tests, and blockers (`~`); never present unverified work as done.
